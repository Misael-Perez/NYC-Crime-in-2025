Datasets:

crime dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/about_data 

U.S income based on zip code: https://rowzero.com/datasets/income-by-zip-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Since the datasets are too large to upload to github, we have compressed the datasets into two zip files. The first one is VisualProject_data_P1.zip, and the second one is VisualProject_data_P2.zip.
